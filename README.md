# Push
### My First Completed Game
### Description:
#### Push is a puzzle game that challenges the player to move through 16 levels that get increasingly difficult as you go.
### How to Play:
#### How the Game Works:
##### The objective of the game is to move the player's character to the finish line (denoted by a pinkish-orange cube). As you move through the game new obstacles will appear that changes the way the player needs to move to finsh the levels. The green cubes will reset the player if hit and the orange cubes fire smaller orange cubes at the players current position. Additionally, each level has a challenge to see if the palyer can use as few pushes as possible to reach the finish line and if you can beat it the level will have a star next to it to show you beat the challenge.
### Controls:
##### Simple just left click anywhere on the screen and the further away from the character you press the more velocity is applied to the chacter in the opposite direction than you pressed.
